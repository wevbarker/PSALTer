# _PSALTer_: Particle Spectrum for Any Tensor Lagrangian
## Version 1.0.0

- Initial release to accompany pre-print and documentation.

## About

_PSALTer_ is a software package for _Mathematica_ designed to predict the propagating quantum particle states in any tensorial field theory, including (but not limited to) just about any theory of gravity. The free action $S_{\text{F}}$ must have the structure
```math
S_{\text{F}}=\int\mathrm{d}^4x\ \zeta(x)^{\text{T}}\cdot\Big[\mathcal{O}(\partial)\cdot\zeta(x)-j(x)\Big],
```
where the ingredients are:
- The dynamical fields $\zeta(x)$ are real tensors, which may be a collection of distinct fields, each field having some collection of spacetime indices ($\mu$, $\nu$, etc.), perhaps with some symmetry among the indices. 
- The wave operator $\mathcal{O}(\partial)$ is a real, second-order (Ostrogradsky's theorem discourages higher-derivative operators, but even if it did not we note that the apparent order may always be lowered by the introduction of extra fields) differential operator constructed from the flat-space metric $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ and partial derivative $\partial_\mu$ (but _not_ the totally antisymmetric $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\sigma\lambda}$ tensor), linearly parameterised by a collection of coupling coefficients.
- The source currents $j(x)$ are conjugate to the fields $\zeta(x)$. They encode all external interactions to second order in fields, whilst keeping the external dynamics completely anonymous.

## Example: massive gravity 

As a demonstration, we consider the Fierz-Pauli linearised massive gravity theory
```math
S=\int\mathrm{d}^4x\ \Big[\alpha\big(-\partial^\mu h_{\mu\nu}\partial^nu h+\tfrac{1}{2}\partial_\mu h\partial^\mu h-\tfrac{1}{2}\partial_\sigma h^{\mu\nu}\partial_\sigma h_{\mu\nu}+\partial_\nu h^{\mu\nu}\partial^\sigma h_{\mu\sigma}\big)+\beta\big(h^{\mu\nu}h_{\mu\nu}-h^2\big)+h^{\mu\nu}T_{\mu\nu}\Big],
```
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coupling coefficients, $h_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric perturbation and $T^{\mu\nu}$ is the linearised stress-energy tensor of matter, which is the source conjugate to $h_{\mu\nu}$.

In a fresh notebook we first load the package:
```
<<xAct`PSALTer`;
```
Next, we define Lagrangian couplings $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as `Coupling1` and `Coupling2` using the command `DefConstantSymbol` from _xAct_:
```mathematica
DefConstantSymbol[Coupling1,PrintAs->"\[Alpha]"];
DefConstantSymbol[Coupling2,PrintAs->"\[Beta]"];
```
Next, we use the command `DefField` from _PSALTer_ to define the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ as the symmetric, rank-two tensor field `MetricPerturbation`:
```mathematica
DefField[
    MetricPerturbation[-a,-b],
    Symmetric[{-a,-b}],
    PrintAs->"\[ScriptH]",
    PrintSourceAs->"\[ScriptCapitalT]"
];
```
The output should look like:

To compute the spectrum, we plug the Lagrangian into the `ParticleSpectrum` function from _PSALTer_:
```mathematica
ParticleSpectrum[
    Coupling1*(
	(1/2)*CD[-b]@MetricPerturbation[a,-a]*CD[b]@MetricPerturbation[c,-c]
	-CD[a]@MetricPerturbation[-a,-b]*CD[b]@MetricPerturbation[c,-c]
	-(1/2)*CD[-c]@MetricPerturbation[a,b]*CD[c]@MetricPerturbation[-a,-b]
	+CD[-b]@MetricPerturbation[a,b]*CD[c]@MetricPerturbation[-a,-c]
    )
    +Coupling2*(
        MetricPerturbation[-a,-b]*MetricPerturbation[a,b]
        -MetricPerturbation[a,-a]*MetricPerturbation[b,-b]
    ),
    TheoryName->"MassiveGravity",	
    Method->"Easy",
    MaxLaurentDepth->3
];
```
The output should look like:

## Documentation 

The documentation notebook is at `PSALTer/xAct/PSALTer/Documentation/English/Documentation.nb`. It is recommended to also read [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09500).

## General use 

### Pre-defined geometry

When you first run `` <<xAct`PSALTer` `` the software defines a Minkowski manifold with the ingredients:

|Wolfram Language|Output format|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|`a`, `b`, `c`, ..., `z`|$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, ... $\zeta$|Cartesian coordinate indices|
|`G[-m,-n]`|$\eta_{\mu\nu}$|Minkowski metric|
|`CD[-m]@`|$\partial_{\mu}$|Partial derivative|

### Provided functions 

_PSALTer_ defines _two_ functions. To define a tensor field you use `DefField`, which has a very similar syntax to `DefTensor` in _xTensor_:
```mathematica
DefField[
    FieldNameValue_[IndsValue___],
    SymmValue_,
    PrintAs->PrintAsValue_,
    PrintSourceAs->PrintSourceAsValue_
];
```
The arguments and options are as follows:
- `FieldNameValue` is the symbolic name of the new field.
- `IndsValue` are the indices of `FieldNameValue`, if any.
- `SymmValue` is the intended index-symmetry on `IndsValue`. The syntax is the same as in `DefTensor`.
- `PrintAsValue` is the string that `FieldNameValue` will use as format. The syntax is the same as in `DefTensor`.
- `PrintSourceAsValue` is the string that the source conjugate to `FieldNameValue` will use as format.

To compute a spectrum, use `ParticleSpectrum`:
```mathematica
ParticleSpectrum[
    LagrangianValue_,
    TheoryName->TheoryNameValue_,
    Method->MethodValue_,
    MaxLaurentDepth->MaxLaurentDepthValue_
];
```
The arguments and options are as follows:
- `LagrangianValue` must be a valid linearised Lagrangian density. The expression must be a Lorentz-scalar. Each term must be quadratic in the field(s) `FieldNameValue` defined using `DefField`. Each term must be linear in coupling constants defined using `DefConstantSymbol` from _xTensor_. Other allowed ingredients are `CD` acting on field(s) `FieldNameValue` and `G` used to contract indices. Do _not_ use an odd power of `epsilonG`, which will result in a parity-odd theory. Do _not_ include the term coupling the fields to their conjugate sources: this is automatically included.
- `TheoryNameValue` can be any string. This is used for labelling the output files.
- `MethodValue` can be either of the strings `"Easy"` (default) or `"Hard"` (experimental, uses home-brewed implementations of the symbolic Moore-Penrose inverse and other innovations).
- `MaxLaurentDepthValue` can be `1`, `2` or `3`. This sets the maximum positive integer $n$ for which the $1/k^{2n}$ null pole residues are requested. The default is `1`, from which the massless spectrum can be obtained. Setting higher $n$ naturally leads to longer wallclock times, but also allows potential (pathological) higher-order/non-simple propagator poles to be identified, down to the requested depth.

## Known bugs 

Currently, all the known bugs affect just the production of the final output graphic and PDF file. The process of producing a vectorised, publication-grade graphic is convoluted; information boxes have to be exported as temporary PDF files, converted to EPS files using _Inkscape_ (not on _Microsoft Windows_), and re-imported as vector graphics to be rectangle-packed and re-exported again. Currently, this is a process which works well only on _Linux_.

:warning: **If you just want to get the science results, without the PDF, you should run in your notebook the line `` xAct`PSALTer`Private`$NoExport=True `` before using `DefField` or `ParticleSpectrum`. This is a temporary fix, and will result in a less compact form of final output graphic that is not exported to a PDF. You can still try to export this graphic manually using the drop-down menus.**

If you decide to continue with the default behaviour, you may encounter the following errors:
1. A reliable error on _macOS_ generating the messages `RunProcess::pnfd` and `Import::fmterr`. As suggested by the messages, check `Environment["PATH"]` in your notebook. The result should include the path of the directory containing the _Inkscape_ binary on your system. You can find out where that binary is located using `which inkscape` in _zsh_, and amend the path accordingly in the notebook using `SetEnvironment`.
2. A sporadic error on all operating systems generating the messages `Transpose::nmtx`, `FindPermutation::norel`, `MapThread::mptd`, `Part::partw`. The cause of this is not clear.
3. A reliable error on _macOS_ and _Microsoft Windows_ involving more-or-less misplaced glyphs in the output graphic. This happens when _PSALTer_ is unable to use _Inkscape_ on the system (the default case for _Microsoft Windows_), and so it defaults to re-importing the PDF graphics rather than converting to EPS. The _Mathematica_ PDF importer is well-known to have lots of problems, and so it usually corrupts the figure to some extent.
4. A sporadic error on _Linux_ and _macOS_ involving missing or incorrect glyphs in the output graphic. This seems to happen when _Inkscape_ was only partially successful. On _Linux_, the problem has to do with installed fonts, and it may be solved by upgrading your system (and rebooting).
